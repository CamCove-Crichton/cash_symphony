During our collaborative and brainstorming sessions, we recognized and valued the unique talents of each team member, aiming to select a project that would be captivating for everyone. This led us to collectively decide to build a front-end application, enabling each team member to actively engage in its development.

Using "Budget Busters: New Year, New Numbers" theme, we developed an application that enables users to enhance their expense tracking. Through forexample, a chart generated from the data that the user inputs, this allows the user to visually compare the distribution of their salary or income across various expenditures.
